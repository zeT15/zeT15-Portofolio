## Overview

Implemented the design team's Figma mock-ups to redesign the Homepage, property listing pages, About Us page, and the Team page.

Reduced the Home page and the property listing pages' time to First Contentful Paint (FCP) by over 40% by purging unused CSS and using compressed hero images while lazy-loading other images.

Helped plan the next-gen software stack to use TypeScript React with TailwindCSS using NextJS hosted on Vercel.
